## ðŸ“„ GAN_assignment.ipynb

This notebook contains an assignment on **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**. The main tasks are:

* To implement and train both a **Fully Connected GAN (FCGAN)** and a **Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)** on the MNIST dataset.
* To generate images at the end of each epoch using a fixed noise vector.
* To create a 5x5 grid visualization to compare the image quality progression over 25 epochs for both FCGAN and DCGAN.

## ðŸ“„ GenAi_Task1.ipynb

This notebook is a **web scraping task**. It includes:

* A sample script to scrape poem information (title, URL, poet) from `poetryfoundation.org`.
* The main goal is to modify the script to scrape similar data (title, URL, author, year) from multiple pages of `poets.org`.

## ðŸ“„ GenAi_Task2.ipynb

This notebook focuses on building a basic **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification. The key objectives are:

* To implement a CNN using **TensorFlow** to classify images from an animal dataset with 15 different classes.
* To evaluate the model's performance by displaying the **F1-score**, **accuracy**, and a **confusion matrix**.
